# Diversity & Inclusion-Dashboard


## Problem Statement

Diversity and inclusion are crucial concepts in creating equitable and thriving environments. Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress.
This dashboard helps them understand the scenario in their organisation better. Through different KPIs, they get to know the area in which they are lagging & thus they can work and improve them.
